Steps on how to create a github:
First, log in to your GitHub account and establish a new public repository titled <username>.github.io, utilizing either your personal GitHub username or your organization's username.

After creating the public repository on GitHub, clone it to your local machine.

Navigate to the cloned repository on your local machine and generate an index.html file.

Once the index file is created for your website, commit the changes and push them to the remote host.

Next, open your preferred web browser and enter your websiteâ€™s URL (<username>.github.io) into the address bar. Your webpage should now be hosted via GitHub Pages and accessible to the public.
What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
Creating HTML and CSS layouts can be time-consuming due to the need for creativity. However, I enjoyed using it to create a website again because it's fulfilling to see your own work. It's also my first time using the flexbox feature, and I realized that this layout model is very helpful because it allows me to easily design flexible and responsive web layouts.
